# Use Case: Customer Purchase Prediction in E-Commerce

### 1. **Data - Datasource, Data Issues, Type of Data**

#### **Data - Datasource**
In an e-commerce platform, the data sources could include:

- **Customer Data**: Collected from the user’s registration details, login information, and past purchase behavior.
- **Product Data**: Information about products such as price, category, stock levels, and discounts.
- **Transaction Data**: Sales transactions, order history, payment methods, and shipping addresses.
- **Behavioral Data**: Data about customer browsing behavior, click-through rates, and items added to the cart.
- **External Data**: Economic trends, social media sentiment, or competitor data (e.g., price changes, product launches).

These data sources can be collected through various means, such as:

- Web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Hotjar).
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems.
- Database systems (e.g., SQL databases).
- Web scraping or external data providers for competitor or market information.

#### **Data Issues**
When dealing with data in this domain, several issues may arise:

- **Missing Data**: Certain records, such as a missing customer email or incomplete product information (e.g., missing product dimensions), can occur, causing incomplete insights.
- **Inconsistent Data**: Variability in how data is recorded, such as date formats or inconsistent product naming conventions, can lead to discrepancies and inaccurate analysis.
- **Duplicate Data**: Multiple records for the same customer or product due to system errors or duplicate submissions from external data sources.
- **Data Latency**: Delay in data synchronization between systems can cause real-time recommendations or analytics to be outdated.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Sensitive customer information (e.g., payment details, personal preferences) needs to be anonymized and securely stored to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR.

#### **Type of Data**
The data types in this use case include:

- **Structured Data**: Organized data such as customer details (name, email, address), transactional data (order ID, product ID, quantity, total), and product attributes (price, category).
- **Unstructured Data**: Text-based data such as customer reviews, feedback, and product descriptions.
- **Semi-structured Data**: Data that is partially organized, like logs or clickstream data, which may contain valuable information but requires preprocessing for analysis.
- **Time-Series Data**: Sales trends over time, customer purchase patterns, and product price fluctuations.
- **Categorical Data**: Customer demographics (age, gender, location), product categories, or customer loyalty tier.
- **Numerical Data**: Purchase amount, order frequency, and customer lifetime value.

### 2. **Problem Statement**

In this use case, the primary problem is to **predict customer purchases** in an e-commerce platform. The problem statement can be defined as:

#### **Problem Statement:**

*The e-commerce platform aims to predict which products a customer is likely to purchase in the next 30 days based on their past browsing behavior, transaction history, and external data such as product availability, seasonality, and discounts. By doing so, the company intends to provide personalized product recommendations and increase sales conversion rates.*

#### **Specific Goals:**

- **Personalization**: Tailor product recommendations based on customer preferences, behavior, and purchase history.
- **Inventory Management**: Predict which products are in high demand and need restocking or promotional offers.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Estimate future sales for different product categories or individual items, assisting with production and stock levels.
- **Customer Retention**: Identify customers who may be at risk of churning and target them with relevant discounts or campaigns to re-engage them.

#### **Challenges in Achieving the Goal:**

- **Data Quality**: Incomplete or noisy data may lead to inaccurate predictions.
- **Changing Customer Behavior**: Shifting customer preferences and trends may affect the model’s performance.
- **Scalability**: The ability to handle large volumes of real-time data efficiently for prediction.
- **Personalization Complexity**: The difficulty in providing truly personalized recommendations without overfitting the model to a narrow set of behaviors.

By addressing these data issues and refining the problem statement, the e-commerce platform can improve its predictive capabilities, offering a better shopping experience to customers and optimizing sales performance.
